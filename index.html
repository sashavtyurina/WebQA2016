            Web search engines have made great progress at answering factoid queries. However, they are not well-tailored for managing more complex questions, especially when they require explanation and/or description.
WebQA workshop aims at exploring diverse approaches to answering questions on the Web. This year, particular emphasis will be given to Community Question Answering (CQA), where comments by the users engaged in the community can be used to answer new questions. Questions posted on the Web can be short and ambiguous (similarly to Web queries to a search engine). These issues make the WebQA task more challenging than traditional QA, and finding the most effective approaches for it remains an open problem.
Unlike the more formal conference format, the aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in diverse areas working on this problem, including those from NLP, IR, social media and recommender systems communities. This workshop is specifically designed for the SIGIR audience. However, due to its format, its goal, as compared to the main conference, is to conduct a more focused and open discussion, encouraging the presentation of work in progress and late-Â­breaking initial results in Web Question Answering. Both academic and industrial participation will be solicited, including keynotes and invited speakers.

                  Getting Rid of the Ten Blue Links
                  </h2>

                  <p>In this talk, I will describe the work we are doing at RMIT to change one of the commonest web pages we all look at: the Search Result Page (SERP). In our work we are looking to replace the SERP with a set of answer passages that address the userâs query. In the context of general web search, the problem of finding answer passages has not been explored extensively. Previous studies have found that many informational queries can be answered by a passage of text extracted from a retrieved document, relieving the user from having to read the actual document. While current passage retrieval methods that focus on topical relevance have been shown to be not effective at finding answers, the result shows that more knowledge is required to identify answers in the document.
                  <br/>
                  We have been formulating the answer passage extraction problem as a summarization task. We initially used term distributions extracted from a Community Question Answering (CQA) service to generate more effective summaries of retrieved web pages. An experiment was conducted to see the benefit of using the CQA data in finding answer passages. We analyze the fraction of answers covering a set of queries, the quality of the corresponding result from the answering service, and their impact on the generated summaries. I will also talk about recent work where we re-rank retrieved passages according to the summary quality and incorporating document summarizability into the ranking function.

                  <p>In this talk Iâll cover some of our recent work on WebQA with CQA data.  Iâll describe a general framework for enriching general Web search with related questions and answers extracted from CQA sites. Iâll get into the details of several components of the platform including identifying Web queries with question intent, high precision retreival from CQA data, and supporting human answers for advice seeking questions. Iâll finally overview the Trec LiveQA track which we organize the second year in a row. This track challenges participants with real-time questions extracted from the live stream of questions submitted to the Yahoo Answers site.
